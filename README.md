# Tutorial Machine Learning in Agricultural Business Economics

To participate in the tutorial, you need a Google Account, which you then use to click on the Google Colab button. With Google Colab you can run all the codes in the cloud without having to install anything on your computers. We start with 01_Tutorial to get to know python. The second tutorial is QuantitativeTutorial.ipynb. If there is time left, we will do the third tutorial Crop_classification.ipynb.
